## Task 1: Create lists and use tuples

## Create lists
# You'll work with state names and county names indicated below.
# state_name	county_name
# Arizona	    Maricopa
# California	Alameda
# California	Sacramento
# Kentucky	    Jefferson
# Louisiana	    East Baton Rouge

# In this task, assign two variables:
#     1. `state_names` - a `list` of each state in the `state_name` column in the table above, in order, as strings
#     2. `county_names` - a `list` of each county in the `county_name` column in the table above, in order, as strings

state_names = ["Arizona", "California", "California", "Kentucky", "Louisiana"]
county_names = ["Maricopa", "Alameda", "Sacramento", "Jefferson", "East Baton Rouge"]
